# ✅ BUILD FIXED - New Build Started!
# ============================================

## 🔧 WHAT WAS WRONG:

The build failed because:
```
# Old (WRONG):
pyzk==0.9  ← This version doesn't exist!

# New (FIXED):
pyzk  ← Will install latest stable version
```

---

## ✅ WHAT I DID:

1. ✅ Fixed `requirements.txt`
2. ✅ Committed the fix
3. ✅ Pushed to GitHub
4. ✅ **New build started automatically!**

---

## 🚀 CHECK NEW BUILD:

Go to: https://github.com/amryehia/attendux-sync-agent/actions

You should now see:
- 🟡 **New build running** (yellow circle)
- Previous build with ❌ (ignore it)

**Wait ~5-7 minutes for new build to complete**

---

## 📊 BUILD PROGRESS:

The build will go through these steps:

1. ✅ Checkout code
2. ✅ Setup Python 3.11
3. 🔄 Install dependencies (this was failing before)
4. 🔄 Download logo
5. 🔄 Build EXE with PyInstaller
6. 🔄 Upload artifact

**Once you see green checkmark ✅ → Download the .exe!**

---

## 📥 AFTER BUILD SUCCEEDS:

1. **Go to Actions:**
   https://github.com/amryehia/attendux-sync-agent/actions

2. **Click the successful build** (green ✅)

3. **Scroll to "Artifacts"** section at bottom

4. **Click "Attendux-Sync-Agent-Windows"** to download

5. **Extract zip file**

6. **You get:** `Attendux-Sync-Agent.exe` (~25-30 MB)
